# Project 4: File System

# Implementation

To implement our file system APIs, we created our own data structures to hold the
metadata when the user mounted the file system. The user could then read and
write to the file system while our APIs would correctly modify the metadata in memory.
When the user unmounts the file system, the metadata is flushed back to the
virtual disk.
